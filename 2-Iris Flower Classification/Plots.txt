Line Plot:
Shows trends in data over a sequence, typically used for time series.
Example: Plotting feature values across different samples to see trends.

Bar Plot:
Displays categorical data with rectangular bars.
Example: Count of each iris species in the dataset.

Scatter Plot:
Shows relationships between two numerical variables.
Example: Sepal length vs. petal length to observe clusters of species.

Box Plot:
Summarizes data distribution using quartiles, highlighting outliers.
Example: Sepal width across different species to compare spread.

Histogram:
Shows the frequency distribution of a single variable.
Example: Distribution of sepal length values in the dataset.

KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) Plot:
A smoothed version of a histogram that shows the probability density.
Example: Shape of petal width distribution across species.

Density Plot:
Similar to KDE but emphasizes areas where values are concentrated.
Example: Distribution of all feature values combined.

Heatmap:
Represents numerical data in a color-coded grid, commonly for correlations.
Example: Feature correlation matrix to see relationships between features.

Pairplot:
Plots pairwise scatter plots for numerical features, helping to spot patterns.
Example: Comparing all feature relationships with species as a hue.
